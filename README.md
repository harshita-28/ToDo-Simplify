# ToDo-Simplify
ToDo Application offers a simple interface to users to perform the CRUD operations and manage their day-to-day tasks in an organized manner.
We identified the following common themes among the users and surveyed:

A Todo list, planner application all in one
-> Great task management application that’s great for organizing your life
-> Login/Signup for extensive security
-> A simple user interface with access to a dashboard
-> Create, assign, organize tasks
-> Delete Tasks

#### Simple UI 
 Following on from quick capture, overall the app should be simple. Simple to use. Simple user interface. Too many features just clutter things up. And 99% of those extra bells and whistles never get used.
#### Functionality 
CRUD using PHP
